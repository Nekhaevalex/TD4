QUESTION: HOW CORE DEBUGGING CAN BE IMPLEMENTED?
Example: A and B registers cannnot be accessed through backplane buses ATM.
Possible solutions:
    - make backplane wider
    - add register headers to core PCB

PCBs to make:
 - core - TD4 itself
 - clock/reset - clock generator (fixed/variable) + reset circuits
 - ROM - all 256 bytes on a single PCB
 - RAM - 16 bytes per PCB
 - backplane - 20 slots for all other PCBs + power circuits

Backplane carries:
    Signals:
    - ROM address - 8 bit
    - ROM data - 8 bit
    - RAM address - 8 bit
    - RAM data - 4 bit
    - RAM Write-Enable - 1 bit
    - RAM Read/Write - 1 bit
    - Clock signal - 1 bit
    - Reset signal - 1 bit
    - IN bus - 4 bit
    - OUT bus - 4 bit
    Subtotal: 40 bit.

    Power:
    - +5V - 4 wires
    - GND - 4 wires

    Total: 48 wires needed.

Will use 3x16 (48 pin) or 2x32 (64 pin) DIN connectors.

Key ICs:
 - latches - 74HC175 - quad D flip-flop
 - RAM - К561РУ2 - 256x1 CMOS SRAM
 - register selector - 74HC155
 - (EEP)ROM -
