PCBs to make:
 - core - TD4 itself
 - clock/reset - clock generator (fixed/variable) + reset circuits
 - ROM - all 256 bytes on a single PCB
 - RAM - 16 bytes per PCB
 - backplane - 20 slots for all other PCBs + power circuits

Backplane carries:
    Signals:
    - ROM address - 8 bit
    - ROM data - 8 bit
    - RAM address - 8 bit
    - RAM data - 4 bit
    - RAM Write-Enable - 1 bit
    - RAM Read/Write - 1 bit
    - Clock signal - 1 bit
    - Reset signal - 1 bit
    - IN bus - 4 bit
    - OUT bus - 4 bit
    - DEBUG_ON - 1 bit
    Subtotal: 41 bit.

    Power:
    - +5V - 4 wires
    - GND - 4 wires

    Total: 49 wires needed.

Will use 2x32 (64 pin) DIN connectors.

Debug headers:
	Core PCB will have additional headers for monitoring registers (A & B)
	and carry flag (both from adder and from register). They are not worth
	it to break them out to back plane, thus new headers (detachable debug).
	Other PCBs may also require similar header.
	DEBUG_ON pin on backplane enables the debug outputs


Key ICs:
 - latches - 74HC175 - quad D flip-flop
 - RAM - К561РУ2 - 256x1 CMOS SRAM
 - register selector - 74HC155
 - (EEP)ROM -
